Code used in the process of solving the problem of finding the $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices that maximizes the number of $H$ subgraphs for any $d,n,H$.
The notebook calculates the relations between different kinds of homomorphism numbers for any graph.
The julia code is used to find good feasible points for certain optimization problems on the eigenvalues of the graph. This was used to support our conjectures before proving them.
